# Title: build-ambari-env.txt 
# Author: WKD
# Date: 200406 
# Purpose: Detailed instructions on building the ADMN lab environment.
# This will build images, run containers, and configure for Ambari.
# Ambari will be running on Admin01. But no other HDP services
# will be installed.

PURPOSE 
Ambari Docker is a training environment intended to support the HDP admin class. This is a complex environment built with a lot of dockerfiles, but it is capable of support many different educational scenarios.

TIME 
01:30:00

PREPS 
Access the Github adm-docker and the volume directory.
1. Ask for access to HWU github. 
2. Clone the github repo for the edu-docker

	% mkdir ~/src
	% cd ~/src
	% git clone URL
 
SETUP EC2 INSTANCE 
Instructions for setting up the Ubuntu Docker Server. We use Ubuntu 16.04 as this is the recommended OS for Docker.
1. Open a JIRA ticket against TOL. Capture the ticket number.
2. Launch a AWS EC2 instance. Use the Bob the Build site.

	http://edulabs.hortonworks.com/bobthebuilder/job/Launch-AMI-With-tags/

3. Complete the build page. This will create all of the required tags and use the correct AMI.

4. Recommend associating an EIP in Route53 under hdplabs. This makes life easier as you stop and start the instance.

	Route 53
        Zone hdplabs.com
        DNS  edu-admn.hdplabs.com

5. Add your Internet Gateway IP Address to the security group
6. Login and validate your private key. I have set my default id_rsa to the training-keypair.pem.

        % ssh -i ~/.ssh/training-keypair.pem ubuntu@hostname
        % exit

SETUP DOCKER SERVER
1. On your local host create the tar file backend for docker setup. There are two directories that must be placed onto the AWS EC2 instance, one with conf files and the other with admin scripts. 
2. Put the setup docker files into a tar file.

	% cd ~/src/edu-docker/HDP/docker-server
	% tar cvf /tmp/edu-docker.tar conf sbin

3. Copy over the tar file

	% scp /tmp/*.tar ubuntu@hostname:/home/ubuntu/

4. Login onto the AWS instance

	% ssh ubuntu@hostname 

5. Extract the edu-docker file

	% tar xvf edu-docker.tar

6. Cleanup

	% rm *.tar 


SETUP DATA
1. The data is pulled in from an S3 bucket. Create a data directory on the ubuntu server. This will be mounted into /var/data on each node.

	% mkdir data
	% cd data

2. Download the zip files from the S3 bucket.

	% wget https://edu-data-wkd.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/book.zip 
	% wget https://edu-data-wkd.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/cloudfin.zip 
	% wget https://edu-data-wkd.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/cloudtel.zip 
	% wget https://edu-data-wkd.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/latin.zip 
	% wget https://edu-data-wkd.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/nyse.zip 

3. Unzip these files.

	% unzip book.zip

4. Delete the zip files
	
	% rm *.zip

INSTALL DOCKER 
1. Run setup for the backend. 
IMPORTANT This requires you to have an account on github, you will need to provided your userid and password to download. Sudo is built into this script, run as ubuntu. 
IMPORTANT Validate the setup file for the correct github repo to clone.

	% ./sbin/setup-ubuntu-docker.sh

2. Provide login for github.

3. You must logout and log back in to setup docker environment. 
IMPORTANT Ensure you do this step.

	% exit 


4. Validate

	% ssh ubuntu@hostname
	% docker container ls

CHECK THE RIGHT BRANCH
The git code should already be in place. This checks for branch and access. You will need acces to the github repo. See JLW.
1. Go to the src directory for the repo

	% cd ~/src/edu-docker
	% git branch 
	% git pull

BUILD IMAGES
Build and repo the images.
1. Run the build. Then review the list of images.

	% edu-docker.sh build

2. If you are submitting the images to a repo. There may be a public repo at Docker hub for wmdailey. I normally skip this task.

	% edu-docker.sh repo

RUN CONTAINERS
This setups for the admn environment. 
1. Run containers

	% edu-docker.sh network
	% edu-docker.sh cluster

3. Validate your cli environment from ubuntu. 

	% ssh sysadmin@admin01 
	% sudo ambari-server status 
	% exit
	% ssh devuser@client01 
	% exit

VALIDATE
1. IMPORTANT Use AWS EC2 instancce to check with a stop/start. 
2. Check the desktop
	https://edu-ambari.hdplabs.com
	BadPass%1
3. In Mate right click and organize icons by name
4. Select Ambari desktop icon and login

SETUP DESKTOP
Customizations to desktop
1. For FCXE arrange the icons on the desktop (Mate does not have grid alignment, each and every time you will have to right click and select organize by name.)
2. Set password for keychain
3. Select Ambari icon.
4. Select Google Chrome as default browser
5. Menu > Systems > Mate Terminal (Pin onto desktop/put on favorites)
6. Menu > Internet > Google Chromee (put on favorites)
7. Change the color of the terminal to black font and white background 

BUILD AMI 
1. Use AWS EC2 to stop the running instance
2. Create an AMI
